##  Welcome to openTENS!

First of all, welcome! 
Thank you for your interest in **openTENS** — an open-source electrical stimulation platform designed for researchers, designers, and developers.

This README provides essential information about the project.  
You can jump directly to the following sections:

##  What Are We Doing?

### Background & Problem

- Most commercial **TENS/EMS devices** are closed systems — users cannot modify waveforms or implement closed-loop control  
- Researchers who want to explore **different stimulation patterns or modes** must build custom circuits, which increases cost and safety risks  
- There is a lack of **standardized hardware interfaces** for combining electrical stimulation with **GSR, EMG, IMU**, or other sensors  
- In wearable applications, the **signal quality and comfort of textile electrodes** remain inconsistent and difficult to evaluate  

###  Our Solution

**openTENS** aims to become an open-source, Arduino-like platform for customizable electrical stimulation:

- Provides **programmable bipolar electrical stimulation output (H-Bridge)**  
- Implements **hardware current limiting and isolation** for user safety  
- Integrates **real-time GSR sensing** for closed-loop control  
- Supports **conductive textile electrodes** and multimodal sensor extensions  
- Open-sourced **both firmware and PCB design**

With openTENS, you can quickly prototype:

- Electrical stimulation + emotion regulation experiments  
- Textile-electrode-based rehabilitation systems  
- Intelligent human-computer interaction and affective computing studies
