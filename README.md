## 👋 Welcome to openTENS!

First of all, welcome! 🎉🎉🎉  
Thank you for your interest in **openTENS** — an open-source electrical stimulation platform designed for researchers, designers, and developers.

This README provides essential information about the project.  
You can jump directly to the following sections:

## 💡 What Are We Doing?

### 🧩 Background & Problem

- Most commercial **TENS/EMS devices** are closed systems — users cannot modify waveforms or implement closed-loop control  
- Researchers who want to explore **different stimulation patterns or modes** must build custom circuits, which increases cost and safety risks  
- There is a lack of **standardized hardware interfaces** for combining electrical stimulation with **GSR, EMG, IMU**, or other sensors  
- In wearable applications, the **signal quality and comfort of textile electrodes** remain inconsistent and difficult to evaluate  

### 🚀 Our Solution

**openTENS** aims to become an open-source, Arduino-like platform for customizable electrical stimulation:

- Provides **programmable bipolar electrical stimulation output (H-Bridge)**  
- Implements **hardware current limiting and isolation** for user safety  
- Integrates **real-time GSR sensing** for closed-loop control  
- Supports **conductive textile electrodes** and multimodal sensor extensions  
- Open-sourced **both firmware and PCB design**

With openTENS, you can quickly prototype:

- Electrical stimulation + emotion regulation experiments  
- Textile-electrode-based rehabilitation systems  
- Intelligent human-computer interaction and affective computing studies

## 👨‍🔬 Who Is Developing openTENS?

**openTENS** is initiated by:

- **Yibo Liu** & **Xiaoming Teng**, School of Advanced Technology, Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU)  
  Supervised by **Prof. Martijn ten Bhömer**

The project is inspired by our previous research on  
*“H-Bridge Bipolar Stimulation System with Real-Time GSR Feedback.”*  
We aim to transform our academic work into an open platform that enables more people to explore EMS technology safely and creatively.
